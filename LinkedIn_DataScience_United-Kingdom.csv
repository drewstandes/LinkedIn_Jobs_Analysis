              ",On-site," <ol> You will need the appropriate RTW in the UK. Example - British passport. You will need to be able to relocate within the UK to work with our clients. </ol>    The world of Data is growing at an extremely rapid pace and the skills needed to work within this space are growing at a similar rate, but how would you like to be at the forefront of this incredible field within 12 weeks, and then be deployed as one of our Data Engineering consultants to hone those skills even further?     What is Data Engineering?  Working within a data role requires transitional skill sets such as numerical and analytical skills, but it is now expanding into managing data in a variety of storage systems (e.g. databases, data warehouses, data lakes) using programming skills in languages like SQL and Python. As businesses store and handle more and more data, skills in Big Data technologies like Hadoop and Spark are increasingly relevant.    Strong communication skills are vital in transforming data to be used by different parts of the business effectively. This could mean ensuring that the data is transformed into the correct format for the data analysts or working closely with the data scientists to ensure that their data pipeline can support their algorithms. Don't worry, you're not expected to know how to do all of this already, that's where we come in.    We want to help you grow into someone that can deal with everything from visualisation tools to big data handling and everything in between. By training in one of our world class academies we will make you a specialist consultant who will then work with our clients to help them realise their business needs.     Why work for us?  We take time and care to develop your abilities and confidence, your success is our success - together we make other businesses stronger.     We have great partners:  What's really great about having a career in tech is that is transcends all industries, and as such we partner with businesses across all sectors - central government, leading consultancies, charities, the UKs largest mobile network operators, the world's leading music and podcast streaming platform, popular insurance groups, banks... the list goes on.

How we deliver?    While We Are Pragmatic In Our Approach To Any Specific Project, If You Don’t Share These Values We Are Unlikely To Be a Good Fit For You    There are some fundamental principles to the way that we deliver.   Cross-functional teams   Agile methods have always emphasised the merit of teams with all the skills necessary to delivery on user’s needs. To work effectively in a multi-disciplinary team it helps to be genuinely interested in the work of those in other roles. We value the flexibility to pick up slack across other areas of capability as well as expertise and specialisation.   Collaboration   We find that diverse groups working together come to better solutions. In user testing this approach builds empathy in the team. In design we collaborate to test ideas and develop alternatives. As a team we work together to improve our approach.   Continuous learning   This applies to product development as it applies to individuals. Our projects are designed to engage with uncertainty creating opportunities to learn. We use experiments, prototypes and hypotheses to learn about user behaviour, design algorithms and select technologies. Our communities of practice provide a space for us to improve and learn from peers. While as individuals a personal training budget enables opportunity to grow and develop.   Outcome Focus   When driving our projects, we focus on outcomes. Knowing how a project will be deemed a success by users and customers enables creativity and innovation.    About You    You’ll be helping to build data-centric solutions for Valtech’s customers, applying engineering discipline to ensure high quality.

Specialist Skills &amp; Requirements    You’ll have gone through the full project lifecycle – and understand how design decisions play out in production. You may have worked in traditional data warehousing environments, but you are up to speed with more contemporary data architectures based on open source technologies.   Experience with varied types of data: tabular, graph, time-series, geospatial, image, etc. Practical knowledge of: Different types of database – relational; document; graph; columnar; key-value. Large scale data processing platforms, typically based on Hadoop / Spark. Business intelligence / analytics products or frameworks Data visualisation frameworks Experience of systems deployment and configuration for cloud platforms, including selection of relevant PaaS / SaaS offerings. Knowledge of data integration technologies. Knowledge of distributed computing &amp; information security Ability to write good quality code in a JVM language like Java or Scala, incorporating disciplines such as Test Driven Development and structured version control; familiarity with Python a bonus.

Collaboration   We find that diverse groups working together come to better solutions. In user testing this approach builds empathy in the team. In design we collaborate to test ideas and develop alternatives. As a team we work together to improve our approach.   Continuous learning   This applies to product development as it applies to individuals. Our projects are designed to engage with uncertainty creating opportunities to learn. We use experiments, prototypes and hypotheses to learn about user behaviour, design algorithms and select technologies. Our communities of practice provide a space for us to improve and learn from peers. While as individuals a personal training budget enables opportunity to grow and develop.

Dstl recognises the importance of diversity and inclusion as people from diverse backgrounds bring fresh ideas. We are committed to building an inclusive working environment in which each employee fulfils their potential and maximises their contribution.

As a Level 5 Senior Data Engineer we are looking for people with the following:    • Experience equivalent to Microsoft’s Azure Data Engineer - Associate or Amazon’s Big Data Specialty and ideally hold one of those certifications.  • Ability to take on responsibility for setting up and maintaining data pipelines, while delegating increasing amounts of work to junior colleagues as they develop their skills.  • Experience in Python programming, able to help others understand the language when they encounter problems or unexpected behaviour.  • Knowledge of at least the basics of some other languages as well.  • Practical experience with Infrastructure as Code, e.g. with Terraform, to help us maintain auditable and version-controlled infrastructure, code and data.  • A willingness to share your skills and knowledge with more junior members of the team (or even colleagues with different backgrounds from other parts of the organisation).    As a Level 6 Principal Data Engineer we are looking for people with the following:    • You will be comfortable working with projects and stakeholders to build a data engineering capability from scratch, or from an immature state:  • You will need to use your knowledge of data engineering to advise on the choice &amp; design of infrastructure and project resourcing requirements.  • At the start of new projects, you will likely be solely responsible for developing the initial data products while training colleagues in the required skills.  • You will work with the data owners to understand their organisation, including their legal and ethical frameworks as well as their purpose and strategy – and share that knowledge with the rest of the team.  • In addition to project work you will be working to develop the division’s Data Engineering capability and capacity in conjunction with other Divisions in Dstl and similar capability areas across MOD and the rest of government.  • You will be able to advise and support others in all of the above skills and ensuring that we keep up with evolving requirements.     Responsibilities  Our immediate requirements come from a project that will use Azure, but we expect that if you know AWS you will be able to pick up Azure. We also have projects using AWS and expect to use both regularly going forward into the future.    In this role you will:    • Create impact whilst supporting strategic and operational decision-making.  • Design and implement data models and data pipelines, using best practice to generate reproducible work.  • Explore and visualise data to present its story in a meaningful way to technical and non-technical audiences.  • Keep abreast of the latest developments in data engineering and actively contribute to capability development.  • Support customers and project teams to understand where data engineering enable projects to add new value.  • Work with Industry and Academia by collaborating with them to ensure that the tasks we place remain on track, are of high quality and receive the benefit of internal expertise.  • Maintain an understanding of data engineering outside Dstl by influencing and contributing to industry, academia, partners across government and international research collaboration initiatives.  • Inform across Government, including potentially briefing senior officials to ensure robust decision making within government.  • Guide and direct the work of others, through technical leadership, to ensure delivery of high impact science and technology.  • Review approaches and outputs ensuring they are technically robust, and follows legal and ethical requirements.    The balance across these will vary across the different career levels with the focus being towards the top of the list at Level 4, and bottom of the list at Level 6.  In all cases, Dstl will support continued professional development.      Important Information  Our work in defence, security and intelligence requires our employees to be UK Nationals who are able to gain a high level of security clearance to undertake the projects we are involved in to protect us from security threats. For this reason, only UK Nationals will be able to apply for this role. If you are an international or dual-national candidate, and you think you have the skills we need, please consider applying to any of our government, security or defence partners.

To accomplish this we've built out a flat organizational structure which we call the ConsenSys Mesh: a network of individuals &amp; teams working autonomously towards the same goal. Our mission is to use these decentralized solutions to fundamentally reshape the economic, social, and political operating systems of the planet.

You will be collaborating with the product organization, data scientists, and business analysts to build both the underlying platform as well as data pipelines. Data pipelines will encompass both large-scale batch processing as well as real-time / stream data pipelines. You will design, develop, and operate data integration pipelines to provide high quality datasets for end user, analytical, and machine learning use-cases.   You will bring a deep understanding of software engineering best practices, such as proper use of source control, end to end testing process, and automated deployment mechanism to build a high quality data platform. While we have existing systems that require support and maintenance, you will also provide expertise to multiple teams at Infura by acting as a subject matter expert on best practices, tooling, and data engineering practices.   Required Skills  First and foremost, we want our data engineers to be great software engineers with a passion for writing high quality code.

Using strong programming skills in a language such as Python, Scala, Java, or Go, you have built production quality ETL pipelines at scale using Spark, Hadoop or similar framework. Ideally, you will have worked with modern data stores: AWS S3 based data lakes, AWS Redshift, or Snowflake. We are looking for a senior level candidate that can understand requirements, work autonomously, and communicate effectively. If taking ownership of scoping problems and delivering pragmatic solutions sounds interesting, this is the role for you   Bonus points for:  We use Druid, so any practical experience with this would be a bonus. Deep experience with data engineering in the AWS ecosystem, experience with orchestration tools (such as Airflow) or experience with infrastructure management tools such as terraform is beneficial. If you don’t check these boxes, don’t sweat it. We’d love to hear from you.   Perks of the Mesh   A dynamic startup environment. ConsenSys is a leader with vision in the blockchain space and we are absorbing a significant portion of the attention.

How we deliver?    While We Are Pragmatic In Our Approach To Any Specific Project, If You Don’t Share These Values We Are Unlikely To Be a Good Fit For You    There are some fundamental principles to the way that we deliver.   Cross-functional teams   Agile methods have always emphasised the merit of teams with all the skills necessary to delivery on user’s needs. To work effectively in a multi-disciplinary team it helps to be genuinely interested in the work of those in other roles. We value the flexibility to pick up slack across other areas of capability as well as expertise and specialisation.   Collaboration   We find that diverse groups working together come to better solutions. In user testing this approach builds empathy in the team. In design we collaborate to test ideas and develop alternatives. As a team we work together to improve our approach.   Continuous learning   This applies to product development as it applies to individuals. Our projects are designed to engage with uncertainty creating opportunities to learn. We use experiments, prototypes and hypotheses to learn about user behaviour, design algorithms and select technologies. Our communities of practice provide a space for us to improve and learn from peers. While as individuals a personal training budget enables opportunity to grow and develop.   Outcome Focus   When driving our projects, we focus on outcomes. Knowing how a project will be deemed a success by users and customers enables creativity and innovation.    About You    You’ll be helping to build data-centric solutions for Valtech’s customers, applying engineering discipline to ensure high quality.

Analysis of requirements in order to understand the design options. Understand and communicate the pros and cons of different technologies and approaches. Collaborate with architects and operations engineers to propose and deploy cloud or on-premises infrastructure.    Specialist Skills &amp; Requirements    You’ll have gone through the full project lifecycle – and understand how design decisions play out in production. You may have worked in traditional data warehousing environments, but you are up to speed with more contemporary data architectures based on open source technologies.   Experience with varied types of data: tabular, graph, time-series, geospatial, image, etc. Practical knowledge of: Different types of database – relational; document; graph; columnar; key-value. Large scale data processing platforms, typically based on Hadoop / Spark. Business intelligence / analytics products or frameworks Data visualisation frameworks Experience of systems deployment and configuration for cloud platforms, including selection of relevant PaaS / SaaS offerings. Knowledge of data integration technologies. Knowledge of distributed computing &amp; information security Ability to write good quality code in a JVM language like Java or Scala, incorporating disciplines such as Test Driven Development and structured version control; familiarity with Python a bonus.

              ",Remote,"  This job is 100% remote - work from anywhere in the world.     About Phaidra  Phaidra is building the future of industrial automation.  The world today is filled with static, monolithic infrastructure. Factories, power plants, buildings, etc. operate the same they've operated for decades — because the controls programming is hard-coded. Thousands of lines of rules and heuristics that define how the machines interact with each other. The result of all this hard-coding is that facilities are frozen in time, unable to adapt to their environment while their performance slowly degrades.  Phaidra creates AI-powered control systems for the industrial sector, enabling industrial facilities to automatically learn and improve over time. Specifically:   The intelligence is provided by reinforcement learning algorithms, which convert raw sensor data into high-value actions and decisions. We focus on industrial applications, which tend to be well-sensorized with measurable KPIs — perfect for reinforcement learning. We enable domain experts (our users) to configure the AI control systems (i.e. agents) without writing code. They define what they want their AI agents to do, and we do it for them.  Our team has a track record of applying AI to some of the toughest problems. From achieving superhuman performance with DeepMind's AlphaGo, to reducing the energy required to cool Google's Data Centers by 40%, we deeply understand AI and how to apply it in production for massive impact.    The configurability point is critical for your role. We believe that technology is the most powerful when it is the most usable. AI is certainly a powerful technology; however, the technical complexity of applying AI has limited its utility within the industrial sector. This is both a massive opportunity and a massive challenge.  Your role is to enable our users to interact with these complex AI technologies in the simplest and most intuitive ways possible. Our users may not be familiar with programming or AI algorithms, but they know more about how their industrial systems operate than anybody else. Your job is to bridge this gap, such that our technology is maximally useful for our users.    From a tactical perspective: we are looking for a driven Fullstack Software Engineer to be a part of our engineering team. You will work directly with senior company leaders, UI/UX designers and Product Managers to design and implement significant parts of the code base. You will have the opportunity to make an immediate impact with your work and guide the product and team as we grow.    The Product Engineering team at Phaidra is responsible for building the tools and applications that our customers use to configure and monitor our AI-powered control systems.     Responsibilities  The ideal candidate has prior experience with full stack software engineering - frontend development, backend development and DevOps activities. At Phaidra, you will:   Contribute to the development of both customer facing and internal products that extend the functionality of Phaidra's core AI platform. Contribute significantly to the frontend development efforts - Convert designs and wire frames into high-quality pixel-perfect UI in React or Angular. Collaborate with UI/UX designers and provide insights from a frontend engineering perspective. Contribute to the design and implementation of the product backends - Write REST &amp; GraphQL based API services Write highly scalable event-driven backend applications Contribute to the improvements to our core AI platform - Large-scale data ingestion and processing. Distributed model training and evaluation. Distributed inference (i.e. automated decision-making) for AI-generated recommendations or direct control. Incorporate new techniques developed by AI researchers in the platform. Build and maintain cloud infrastructure on GCP. Perform DevOps duties of CI/CD, Release &amp; Deployment management.     Key Qualifications   0+ years of work experience. Bachelors or Masters in Computer Science, or equivalent experience. Full stack development experience Experience in JavaScript, CSS3 (preferably with a pre-processing framework like SASS/SCSS) &amp; HTML5 Expertise in a modern JavaScript SPA framework like React, Vue or Angular. Experience writing and using REST, GraphQL and/or gRPC services. Experience modeling relational and non-relational data. Experience with a cloud service like AWS, GCP, Azure or similar. Share our company values: curiosity, ownership, transparency &amp; directness, outcome-based performance, and customer empathy.     Preferred Qualifications   Multiple years of experience using an SPA framework. Experience developing production level backend applications. Experience with DevOps and SRE activities like CI/CD and on-call. Exposure to ML engineering is a big plus - feature engineering, distributed model training, tuning &amp; inference, etc. Strong critical thinking skills, great communication skills, and passion for delivering exceptional customer experience.

Training is foundational; functional, customer immersion, and development training. Medical/dental/vision insurance (offerings based on region). We cover 100% of the premium for employees and 50% of the premium for dependents. Unlimited paid time off. MacBook and home office setup stipend.     Base Salary Range  56,300 - 91,600 GBP  This role will also include equity.     On being Remote  We are thoughtful about remote collaboration. We look to the pioneers - like Gitlab - for inspiration and best practices to create a stellar remote work environment. We have a documentation first culture and actively practice asynchronous communication in everything we do. We are deliberate about documenting and living our values - of which accessibility, transparency, and agility are key. Our team stays connected through tools like Slack and Video Chat. We meet daily and have dedicated all-hands meetings to build strong relationships. We hold virtual team building events - and even hold virtual socials to watch rocket launches! We will have in-person All-Hands meetings once a year as travel opens back up.

              ",On-site," We started in 2012, when we noticed a problem: on average, it was taking eight weeks (and a lot of paperwork) for small businesses to apply for a loan. Worse still, more often than not, that process was ending in a ‘no’.   We knew that bakeries, building firms, salons and solicitors deserved better. They deserve to be able to grow – hire more hands, invest in stock, market themselves – without all the hold music and absurdly rigid criteria.   We’ve now been around for a decade   And in that time, we’ve:   grown to a team of 290 iwocans worked with over 50,000 small businesses across the UK and Germany redesigned the whole business loan process from start to finish – our record is three minutes, 26 seconds.    It’s a good start, but it’s just the beginning. Our mission is help one million businesses who need us, so we still have a long way to go.   Here’s what we’ve learned about lending along the way:   Technology is the way to change this space    From automated decisions to API integrations, tech has the potential to create the changes small businesses have been waiting for – so we can’t stop innovating.   Embedded finance is the future    More and more, we’re reaching customers by embedding our loans within the apps and systems they use everyday. Our partners are people like neobanks, online marketplaces and accountancy software companies.   Payments and credit are converging    Lots of small businesses struggle with cash flow; often getting invoices paid from their customers months after paying their own bills. Loans can help them pay these bills, but we also want to tackle the problem at its root by improving payment terms.   New products are always possible    We’re working to create new loans of all shapes and sizes, and we’ve recently launched iwocaPay to help with these cash flow conundrums. So what’s next?

                London, England, United Kingdom
              ",On-site," Why Deliveroo?  When you first think about Deliveroo, you probably think of getting great food to your house in less than half an hour. Awesome right? But behind the scenes is the real story. This story is one of high growth, huge challenges and an enormous opportunity ahead of us. It began with our founder Will, arriving in London in 2004 and finding it almost impossible to order great food, despite the wealth of incredible restaurants in the city. In 2013 Deliveroo was launched. Fast forward to 2020 and we operate in 12 markets with over 60,000 riders who deliver orders from 60,000 restaurants in over 500 cities worldwide.   We want to be the definitive food company - the app you go to any time you have a hunger pang. We are transforming the way people think about food. We are providing people with limitless access to different cuisines and restaurants, turning cooking from a chore to a choice, and giving people the freedom to eat what they want, when they want, where they want it.   We work with riders, restaurants and consumers. We operate one of the most complex three sided marketplaces in the world and we do this in real time. Millions of customers and thousands of restaurants and riders rely on us to match them within milliseconds. The algorithms behind that marketplace are the secret sauce that allows us to deliver our orders in around 30 minutes.   And we're just getting started.   The scale of the opportunity ahead of us is immense. The global food market is valued at £7.7 trillion but only 1% of it is currently online. Contrast that with the digital disruption of countless other industries - from banking and travel to retail and communications - it's clear that our journey in the food sector has only just begun.   We are already a multi-billion pound company that has grown rapidly. Deliveroo came top in the FT's' list of Europe's fastest growing 1000 companies in 2018, and we were the first company ever to win Deloitte's 'UK Top 50' two years in a row. Yet most of the extraordinary value this company will generate lies ahead of us.   The Role  Working as part of our analytics engineering team, your role will be to provide clean, tested, well-documented and well-modelled data sets, that will to enable and empower data scientists and business users alike, via tools like Snowflake and/or Looker.   You'll work with product engineering teams to ensure modelling of source data meets downstream requirements.   You will maintain and develop SQL data transformation scripts, and advise and review data scientists on data modelling to achieve denormalised and aggregated output datasets.   You'll work with data scientists and other analytics engineers to surface clean, intuitive datasets in our BI tool, Looker.   You will be responsible for optimisation and further adoption of Looker as a data product in the business, catering to ~1500 current active users who need to discover and interact with data.    Required    Skillset   Excellent SQL skills Understanding of data warehousing, data modelling concepts and structuring new data tables Good working knowledge of cloud based MPP data warehousing (e.g. Snowflake, BigQuery, Redshift)    Desired / nice to have   Experience developing in a BI tool (Looker or similar) Good practical understanding of version control SQL ETL/ELT knowledge, experience with DAGs to manage script dependencies Python coding skills, particularly in the areas of automation &amp; integrations Good knowledge of the Looker API Good communications skills across all levels of stakeholder (business &amp; technical) An ability to break down and explain complex technical concepts to business end users    Life at Deliveroo  We are a growing team, with very large impact, seeking to answer some of the most interesting questions out there. We move fast, we're always looking for new ideas and we're very transparent about the decisions we make and why we make them.   There are so many questions we need to answer and plenty more we haven't even encountered. How do data and technology help restaurants to grow as consumer habits change? How can we predict what someone wants to order for dinner long before the idea has even crossed their mind? At Deliveroo these are just some of the tough problems we are solving - and there is no challenge that cannot be yours. No solution is owned by a particular team, which means the scope for growth and personal impact is enormous.   Diversity  We believe a great workplace is one that represents the world we live in and how beautifully diverse it can be. That means we have no judgement when it comes to any one of the things that make you who you are - your gender, race, sexuality, religion or a secret aversion to coriander. All you need is a passion for (most) food and a desire to be part of one of the fastest growing start-ups around. "

The systems we manage are mission-critical, running at a 100TB's to PB's scale on hundreds of bare metal servers, whilst supporting some very demanding workloads 24x7.   The role is a mixture of development and operational work - operationally we need to keep the services performant, secure, reliable, available and efficient, but doing that at our scale requires developing and maintaining our own in-house tooling and monitoring infrastructure. The practical knowledge from the operational work is key to building effective tooling, the tooling is key to keeping the operational work in check.   It is also important to note that we run open-source storage software, namely PostgreSQL, Apache Kafka, Apache Solr, Apache HBase, Apache Airflow, all running on Linux containers and servers. One advantage of this is that we can develop deep expertise in these systems, and we aim to feed our improvements back to the wider community..   If this sounds interesting then we'd love to hear from you!

You'll also be expected to take a full part in the life of the team and, as your experience grows, start designing and improving the infrastructure we run. We maintain a balance between project work and operational/ad-hoc work for all members in the team, whether they are senior or recent graduates, and your day-to-day work will be a mix of these also. The exact project work will depend on your experience and interests, but previous projects have included; building out AWS data synchronisation in Rust, coding up MapReduce jobs to validate 140TB of constantly changing data in an HBase table, writing Python code to migrate clients across our Solr clusters, to name but a few. Remote working is possible for this role, though we do have a preference towards working from the Brighton office while your initial induction and training happens.    What you have:   An interest and curiosity in large-scale storage systems and open source software Experience programming small to medium sized projects, ideally in Python, Rust, Go, Java, C or C++ Demonstrable experience running Linux, MacOS or a BSD-based Unix using the command line, either as your desktop or as a server.

              ",On-site," Do you want to work on the most pressing problem of our generation?   We're building the infrastructure for the net zero transition, and we're looking for brilliant engineers, designers, and data scientists who want to help define a low carbon future.   Decarbonizing the economy requires a granular, real-time view of where emissions come from and how they might be reduced. We build software to automate the carbon footprinting of supply chains. Banks, traders, and manufacturers use our product to tame the complexity of international supply networks, identify the most carbon-intensive parts, and find greener alternatives. We were part of the Y Combinator Summer 2020 batch and have secured backing from the UK government's innovation arm, InnovateUK, the NatWest accelerator and the London Business School Incubator.   To join Carbon Chain, you'll be a keen technologist who loves to learn from others. Our company is made up of 10 passionate people with expertise ranging from oil refining to deep learning. Between us we've run Amazon's European supply chain, built JustEat's corporate meal delivery platform, and monitored industrial emissions with satellites for Al Gore. We've got MBAs and PhDs but we know that there's a lot we don't know, and we're hoping you can help fill that gap.   What will you be responsible for at Carbon Chain?   As the world wakes up to the reality of climate change and the need to decarbonize, there's a pressing need to understand the carbon intensity of every activity in the economy. Your job as Data Engineer is to work with our Data Scientists to organize, automate, and deploy the data pipelines we need to provide that understanding.   We're a small team of versatile technologists and we don't believe in a siloed approach. Our data engineers sit side by side with software engineers and designers, making sure that we have the data we need to provide the experience our customers want. You'll be deeply embedded in the product team, with your work being deployed to clients every week. You'll work closely with our domain experts, and have the chance to present to clients if that's something that excites you.   You can expect to have:   Ownership of your projects An independent path to production The ability to make real changes with tangible business value    Our data science stack is predominantly Python. We deploy our work in a variety of ways depending upon the challenge, from Lambdas to Docker containers. Our ETL is run in Dagster, which is a friendlier and more modern version of Airflow. You'd be joining an experienced team but you'd be the first data engineer, so you'd have lots of scope to define best practices and choose your tools.   We're interested in talking to people with DevOps and classical software engineering experience, as well as those coming from Data Science who have a passion for scaling ETL systems.   Our only must-haves are possessing a hunger to solve business challenges using technology, the ability to build close relationships with your team, and the right to work in the UK.   Which tools, technologies, and processes will you work with?   Data processing with the standard scientific stack (Pandas, Numpy, Scipy) and beyond Automation with Dagster and Github Actions Deployment via GCP Containerised applications are the key to our technology vision allowing us to replicate production environments locally and scale services at will. Object-oriented code forms the bulk of our codebase. PostgreSQL and DynamoDB managed databases form the persistence layer - you'll learn to navigate document and relational databases and appreciate the values in both worlds. Infrastructure automation is owned by the whole team, helping to spread the DevOps mentality across the whole technology department (and beyond).    You don't need to be a pro at all of these skills to apply for the role, but we'd love to hear about any relevant knowledge and experiences that you have in these areas.   What we require from applicants   Right to work in the UK and willingness to come to London office 2+ days a week 1+ years of commercial Data Engeering, Data Science, or Software Engineering experience A passion for environmental issues A demonstrated interest in building products and collaborating tightly with scientists and engineers The grit and energy to work in an early stage startup    What we're offering   Competitive salary + generous equity package Flexible working hours - we encourage regular breaks and being AFK (away from keyboard) to support your wellbeing Flexible working location (we like to meet in the office couple of times every week) £1000 annual development allowance for you to spend on developing your current skills and learning new things Tech equipment of your choice Team lunch on Wednesdays, and frequent pub trips Pakt coffee and snacks of your choice in the office 28 days holiday + bank holidays    We're striving to build a diverse team and we would love to hear from applicants from backgrounds less frequently represented in technology, be that in terms of gender, race, or professional background.

                United Kingdom
              ",Remote," The Opportunity  Abnormal Security’s Account Takeover team is defining the next generation of security for Software as a Service and cloud offerings. Enterprises of all sizes have begun to adopt cloud offerings from google docs to box to slack: work that once took place in a single office building or behind a firewall is now happening out on the open internet, and criminals are very aware of the opportunities to steal data, hijack important financial information, and otherwise compromise companies that use these cloud services. Help us build a new layer of protection that will give enterprises the same level of security for their cloud offerings as Abnormal Security’s industry leading products do in the email security space.   We’re looking to add a Founding Full-Stack Engineer to our team, who will report to our Director of Engineering,  David Hagar  , work alongside our CTO,  Sanjay Jeyakumar  , and collaborate with our world-class team.  The individual in this role will shape and elevate our Account Takeover (ATO) team by streamlining the layers of our architecture while working closely with our customers–internal and external alike. This role straddles the line of velocity and excellence.   As a Founding Full-Stack Engineer of the ATO team, you will:   Own and develop data-rich, consumer-grade, user interfaces and APIs for integrating third party solutions into Abnormal’s unified cloud protection product Build the user interface that allows customers and internal agents to debug particular attacks Build a framework and specification for quickly adding new data sources, and then integrate the first data sources as proof of concept for our customers Obsessively partner with our customers to gather their feedback and quickly iterate to improve our systems - example - help resolve FP/FN or integration issues. Create a magical work environment with colleagues and memorable interview process for candidates    This is a full stack role: expect to move from tasks such as coding the UI for Cloud Unity one day, while spending the next working on the data integration platform that pulls in logs and events from cloud offerings, or perhaps diving into the ML systems used to detect attacks. Additionally, we will be building this with heavy customer input and are looking for someone excited to deal with customers, taking their feedback to quickly iterate and improve our systems.   This is a unique opportunity in which engineers from various backgrounds could thrive. Here are just a few examples of profiles we think could be excellent:   A full stack engineer who has worked at scale and enjoys building products from the ground up A customer-focused engineer who loves the idea of getting directly involved with our users to hear what’s working and what isn’t An aspiring entrepreneur who wants a rare opportunity to sit alongside our CTO to build a startup within a scale-up. A full-stack generalist who has spent time building pieces of something, but who wants more ownership designing a system from end-to-end    Requirements:   Strong Computer Science fundamentals We prefer candidates who have at least 3 years of experience building &amp; operating scalable web applications with modern frontend frameworks    There are a lot of opportunities for growth and career advancement–it’s up to you own your career here. Some potential career paths for this role include:   Continuing to grow into a senior, staff, and/or tech lead individual contributor role Moving from an individual contributor role into an Engineering Management position Positioning yourself to learn a ton, build an insanely great network, so you can be a Founder of your own company    We’re a tight-knit group of diverse, boundary-breaking colleagues, where everyone feels welcome and can contribute the best work of their careers. You might be a culture-add if the following describes you:   You’re a fast learner who moves swiftly and autonomously, iterating on your learnings in real-time. You don’t need knowledge or experience in cyber security, but you should be excited about the mission and eager to learn about the industry quickly. You have a deeply-embedded kinetic drive that propels them to make the impossible possible. You are an owner who takes full responsibility for your work. You are not a problem shuffler. You understand how your work impacts the business and proactively seek information to stay informed and act as a business owner, in which there is no task beneath you. You love building technology solutions that delight customers - internal and external alike. Yes, sometimes that means you are okay working late or rising early. You take a principle-based approach to building products/processes. You are intentional about improving 1% better everyday. You have high standards, we do too.    For us to realize our ambition as a company  ,  we are going to need to do more, do better, and grow faster than any company has in our industry. This growth and our future ambition require more leadership and talent than we have today. Below are the guiding principles and the behavioral values that we look for in all company leaders:   Velocity: to move fast, make decisions quickly to help us outpace attackers and outpace our competition (even if we make mistakes) Ownership: to empower ourselves to step up as leaders and take initiative with responsibility (even outside our comfort zone) Intellectual Honesty: to be curious and open-minded about the world, to fearlessly, and respectively share our beliefs (even if awkward) Customer Obsession: to always work backward from customer priorities to help focus our work (even if we feel like we know better) Excellence: to constantly push and challenge ourselves to achieve our ambition of being the best (even if it feels overwhelming at times)    Tech Stack:   Language: Python Platform: AWS (Azure in the future) through Terraform, Docker, ECS Frameworks: Django, Celery Storage: MySQL, Postgres, Redis Frontend: Typescript, React    We offer you:   The opportunity to be part of a truly special team (we have 4.9 stars on both Glassdoor and Gartner Reviews).
