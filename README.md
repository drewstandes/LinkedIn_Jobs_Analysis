# Analyzing Job Postings for Data Scientist and Machine Learning 
- This repo is a small project that I used to gather some insights into the technical requirements for Data Science 
and Machine Learning Jobs posted on LinkedIn. 

## To use: 
- run Scraping_LinkedIn_Jobs.py with your own user name and password (unfortunately the scraping can be temperamental. You may have to retry with or without headless option and you will only be able to scrape up to a certain point. I didn't work out why I couldn't scrape every single posting available). This will generate some csv files for each Country specified. 
- run main.py and open the link generated
