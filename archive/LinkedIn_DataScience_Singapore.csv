Description    Vibrations in modern structures such as cars, robots and industrial machinery, constitute a real problem that can cause undesirable noise, diminished precision, energy loss and damages. In order to reduce these harmful effects, passive materials have been extensively used but can no longer cope with the increasing complexity of engineering systems. In this sense, novel smart structures, which benefit from precision mechanics, sensors, actuators and electronic controllers, have been created to efficiently suppress vibrations without notable adverse effects.  PiezoRobotics is a deep tech engineering start-up specialized in the design and manufacturing of vibration technologies based on smart piezoelectric materials. We create solutions in active vibration control and vibration condition monitoring for the sectors of Advanced Manufacturing, Transportation and IoT Sensors. We are looking for a passionate, talented and hands-on Mechatronics Engineer to join our team in Singapore. Come shape the future of engineering with us!     Responsibilities     First, you will receive an on-the-job training, to get to know our projects and familiarize yourself with our technical capabilities and know-how. Later on, you will be responsible for conceptualizing, designing and testing mechatronic systems (mechanics + electronics + software) for structural vibration control in different applications. As part of our team, you will contribute to the generation of new ideas and the development of advanced technologies. You should be able to understand the customer‚Äôs needs and translate technical requirements into product design and components selection. Different from engineering in large enterprises, you will have the opportunity to support the team throughout the whole product development process, from ideation, simulation, prototyping and testing all the way to series production and delivery. You will have the opportunity to work in a fast-paced environment and will need to have good communication and teamwork with colleagues, external partners, collaborators, suppliers and customers. You will handle multiple projects at the same time, so you will need good attention to details, organizational practices and project management skills, such as planning and documentation.       Skills and qualifications     You have a Bachelor/Master Degree in Engineering (Mechatronics, Mechanical, Electrical/Electronics, Aerospace, Robotics, Control, Automation or similar). You have 1-3 years of experience in similar mechatronic projects (industrial or academic). You have excellent knowledge of fundamental physics/engineering principles. You bring along advanced experience in Mechanics (Structural Dynamics, CAD, Finite Element Simulation, CNC Manufacturing and 3D Printing); in Electronics (Sensors, Instrumentation, Data Acquisition Systems, SPICE Simulation, Datasheet Reading, PCB Design, PCB Manufacturing, Soldering and Testing); and in Data Analysis and Programming (Matlab, Signal Processing Techniques, Linear Control Theory, Microcontrollers Programming, such as Arduino, Raspberry Pi and DSP).

The contract may be renewable.   Project Title: A Multimodal Learning Analytics Approach Towards Learner Dashboard Designs for Better Engagement and Metacognitive Regulation (LADDER)  [OER 25/21 EK]  In Singapore, while blended learning is commonplace, home-based learning is set to become more prevalent, brought about by the pandemic situation. Together with the ubiquity of 1-1 devices, students have many opportunities to learn with digital tools and learning environments. When using these tools, many provide student-facing dashboards of students‚Äô learning activity data. Dashboards have much potential to become metacognitive tools for students to make sense of their learning, to develop metacognitive regulation skills. Still, some students may not be engaged with the dashboards and usage of the dashboard can be low. Additionally, the design of dashboards can lead to different kinds of engagement and impact among students. Therefore, an understanding of the engagement of students with learner dashboards, alongside dashboard design conditions, is crucial in the context of blended learning and home-based learning. An emerging area in the field of education and learning analytics is multimodal learning analytics (MMLA). MMLA techniques, through multimodal data streams, captures time spans and the processes of learning, such that students‚Äô learning activities can be more reliably calibrated and predicted, bringing to light greater insights on the learning phenomenon. Therefore, an MMLA approach, using multiple data streams to trace students‚Äô learner dashboard engagement, allows us to pay attention to the process of learners‚Äô engagement. Although many MMLA studies have been in lab-based contexts, this project recognizes the important research-policy-practice nexus, and will subsequently examine dashboard engagement in ecological contexts. Ultimately, this MMLA approach to understanding learners‚Äô engagement helps to provide a stronger theoretical and empirical basis to establish dashboard design conditions for better engagement in ecological learning environments, preparing future-ready learners for a complex and information-rich world.   This exciting position at the forefront of learning innovations aims to develop the multimodal learning analytics pipeline and analysis for learning engagement on web-based collaborative learning environments in Singapore schools. The candidate must be motivated and independent in supporting the development needs and able to communicate well to multiple stakeholders.    Requirements   PhD in Computer Science/Engineering, Electric/Electronic Engineering, Physics, Mathematics or equivalent. Talent and dedication for programming. Familiar with machine learning techniques and libraries SVM, random forests and other standard ML methods  Unsupervised learning (manifold learning and clustering)  Deep learning (CNN, LSTM, transformers, autoencoders, etc.)  TensorFlow, Pytorch, Numpy, scikit-learn.
