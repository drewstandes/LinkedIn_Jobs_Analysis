              ",Remote,"  This job is 100% remote - work from anywhere in the world.     About Phaidra  Phaidra is building the future of industrial automation.  The world today is filled with static, monolithic infrastructure. Factories, power plants, buildings, etc. operate the same they've operated for decades — because the controls programming is hard-coded. Thousands of lines of rules and heuristics that define how the machines interact with each other. The result of all this hard-coding is that facilities are frozen in time, unable to adapt to their environment while their performance slowly degrades.  Phaidra creates AI-powered control systems for the industrial sector, enabling industrial facilities to automatically learn and improve over time. Specifically:   The intelligence is provided by reinforcement learning algorithms, which convert raw sensor data into high-value actions and decisions. We focus on industrial applications, which tend to be well-sensorized with measurable KPIs — perfect for reinforcement learning. We enable domain experts (our users) to configure the AI control systems (i.e. agents) without writing code. They define what they want their AI agents to do, and we do it for them.  Our team has a track record of applying AI to some of the toughest problems. From achieving superhuman performance with DeepMind's AlphaGo, to reducing the energy required to cool Google's Data Centers by 40%, we deeply understand AI and how to apply it in production for massive impact.    The configurability point is critical for your role. We believe that technology is the most powerful when it is the most usable. AI is certainly a powerful technology; however, the technical complexity of applying AI has limited its utility within the industrial sector. This is both a massive opportunity and a massive challenge.  Your role is to enable our users to interact with these complex AI technologies in the simplest and most intuitive ways possible. Our users may not be familiar with programming or AI algorithms, but they know more about how their industrial systems operate than anybody else. Your job is to bridge this gap, such that our technology is maximally useful for our users.    From a tactical perspective: we are looking for a driven Fullstack Software Engineer to be a part of our engineering team. You will work directly with senior company leaders, UI/UX designers and Product Managers to design and implement significant parts of the code base. You will have the opportunity to make an immediate impact with your work and guide the product and team as we grow.    The Product Engineering team at Phaidra is responsible for building the tools and applications that our customers use to configure and monitor our AI-powered control systems.     Responsibilities  The ideal candidate has prior experience with full stack software engineering - frontend development, backend development and DevOps activities. At Phaidra, you will:   Contribute to the development of both customer facing and internal products that extend the functionality of Phaidra's core AI platform. Contribute significantly to the frontend development efforts - Convert designs and wire frames into high-quality pixel-perfect UI in React or Angular. Collaborate with UI/UX designers and provide insights from a frontend engineering perspective. Contribute to the design and implementation of the product backends - Write REST &amp; GraphQL based API services Write highly scalable event-driven backend applications Contribute to the improvements to our core AI platform - Large-scale data ingestion and processing. Distributed model training and evaluation. Distributed inference (i.e. automated decision-making) for AI-generated recommendations or direct control. Incorporate new techniques developed by AI researchers in the platform. Build and maintain cloud infrastructure on GCP. Perform DevOps duties of CI/CD, Release &amp; Deployment management.     Key Qualifications   0+ years of work experience. Bachelors or Masters in Computer Science, or equivalent experience. Full stack development experience Experience in JavaScript, CSS3 (preferably with a pre-processing framework like SASS/SCSS) &amp; HTML5 Expertise in a modern JavaScript SPA framework like React, Vue or Angular. Experience writing and using REST, GraphQL and/or gRPC services. Experience modeling relational and non-relational data. Experience with a cloud service like AWS, GCP, Azure or similar. Share our company values: curiosity, ownership, transparency &amp; directness, outcome-based performance, and customer empathy.     Preferred Qualifications   Multiple years of experience using an SPA framework. Experience developing production level backend applications. Experience with DevOps and SRE activities like CI/CD and on-call. Exposure to ML engineering is a big plus - feature engineering, distributed model training, tuning &amp; inference, etc. Strong critical thinking skills, great communication skills, and passion for delivering exceptional customer experience.

Training is foundational; functional, customer immersion, and development training. Medical/dental/vision insurance (offerings based on region). We cover 100% of the premium for employees and 50% of the premium for dependents. Unlimited paid time off. MacBook and home office setup stipend.     Base Salary Range  56,300 - 91,600 GBP  This role will also include equity.     On being Remote  We are thoughtful about remote collaboration. We look to the pioneers - like Gitlab - for inspiration and best practices to create a stellar remote work environment. We have a documentation first culture and actively practice asynchronous communication in everything we do. We are deliberate about documenting and living our values - of which accessibility, transparency, and agility are key. Our team stays connected through tools like Slack and Video Chat. We meet daily and have dedicated all-hands meetings to build strong relationships. We hold virtual team building events - and even hold virtual socials to watch rocket launches! We will have in-person All-Hands meetings once a year as travel opens back up.

Every day is interesting and varied here so we offer the stability and comfort of a long term position without sacrificing variety and personal development.We've worked remotely for years yet we collaborate a lot so you'll be expected to help others to complete their work and seek help from others when you need it too.

This also includes some verbal technical questions based on the technology we use every day, we don't believe in asking silly trick questions.For those that progress to the second stage, the second interview is a work simulation performed over a video call. You will have two tasks explained to you and will be left alone to concentrate and work on them (via a remote machine so you don't need to worry about setting your own computer up for the task). Afterwards, you can take us through what you've done and we'll give us some feedback there and then too.

Two of the company’s three directors are developers — and that includes the CEO. This means that development is core to the business, developers are appreciated for their creative input, and the importance of investment in development — and avoiding technical debt — is understood.    We use a cutting-edge containerised development model, that makes agile development convenient and cheap, using Dockside, our online IDE. For each new task, Dockside lets us launch a disposable development container — aka a devtainer — which provides a self-contained fully-functioning development environment running a full live NewsNow stack (talking to a disposable live database clone) complete with high-end browser-based VS Code-compatible IDE. This makes forking, staging and code-review a breeze. From conception through roll out, branches and staged developments are continuously available as needed to developers, managers and testers for collaboration, feedback and review.    We run Debian Linux, Apache, MySQL with Python 3, Perl 5, and Node on the server-side, with TensorFlow/Keras for ML, and HTML5, CSS3 (SASS/SCSS) and modern JavaScript (OO ES6+ &amp; Vue.js framework) on the client-side.    All our software is containerised and deployed using Docker Swarm services on our own co-located raw metal or in Google Cloud.

As an incentive to join NewsNow, we will look to offer candidates their current market rate or above.    Furthermore, we run a programme of annual (or even more frequent) appraisals and pay reviews, with the aim of ensuring our employees are motivated, fulfilled, and that their remuneration reflects and recognises their developing expertise (whether transferable skills, or knowledge of our particular stack), their value to NewsNow, and on the wider job market.     Benefits  All our positions are fully remote - work from home 100% of the time. We offer flexible working for all team members (we’re a family-friendly company) with occasional in-person meetups.

Running stably and profitably since our start in 1997, since 2009 we've been ad funded — experiencing great commercial success as an industry leader in programmatic advertising technologies — however today we are actively exploring how, together with other news organisations, we can move towards a future where public interest news and journalism is funded sustainably by the people it serves.

The world is in the midst of an accelerated transition towards a digital-first future where every company is becoming a tech company. The resulting outcome is that the demand for developers is now at its highest ever and the number of people learning programming skills is accelerating rapidly. In fact, Microsoft estimates the number of coders to be at 200 million by 2025 - 4X what it is today!   Despite that, the representation of developers, how we interact, and find new opportunities is completely fragmented. Existing networks are not meeting the needs of people who can code. Generalised networks that cater to all professional categories cannot optimise their features and workflows around a specific niche like Coders.

We will change the way the coders interact, connect and transact with each other and the world.   The Role   You Will Be Responsible For    Work collaboratively, and in a dynamic fast-paced startup environment.

Work well individually and in teams. Design, develop and test software frameworks. To debug functional, performance and stability issues across the stack. Participate in design and code reviews.   Ideal Profile   Familiarity writing in JavaScript or Typescript in the React framework. Experience building responsive layouts with CSS and HTML Experience with modern browser technologies Strong communication and problem-solving skills Self-awareness, a positive attitude, a sense of humour, and empathy You are NOT required to be completing or have recently completed a Bachelor's or Master’s degree in Computer Science, Engineering or related field, or equivalent training, Bootcamp program, fellowship, or work experience. In the world we live in today, that is backward. Preferred familiarity with React, NextJs, Javascript, Typescript You love to code. Very willing to learn and passionate about building products.

We help pharma, biotechs, biobanks, and patient organisations to run digital and at-home personalised medicine research that is faster, and more cost-effective than traditional approaches.   Taking part in research is currently hard to do and a poor experience for the patient. Finding out about opportunities is haphazard, and there is often little meaningful return for those who take the time and care to get involved. The result is that organisations with cutting edge theories and medicines to test, can't find the right patients to work with. To discover cures for the diseases that affect us and our families, we need to enable people to contribute to medical science, effortlessly and on their own terms. We founded Sano to enable medical research that is data-driven and puts patients at the centre of the experience.   Today, the Sano platform is helping tens of thousands of people connect to relevant research projects including clinical trials which are testing new medicines. By the end of 2022, we expect to be helping hundreds of thousands of people.   We are a team of 25 people today, so this is an exceptional chance to join early in our journey to help define our culture and the company's mission.
