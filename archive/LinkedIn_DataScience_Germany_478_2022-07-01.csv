              ",Remote," Growth is the top priority for every company. Yet the best tools and practices are restricted to a few elite companies who can hire hundreds of engineers and data scientists. Everybody else loses $19 out of every $20 on generic marketing. Mutiny is building a no-code platform that helps companies convert that waste into actual customers and revenue by personalizing experiences based on who is actually viewing. Our greatest differentiator comes from the machine learning models we’ve built that learn across our platform and help our customers make the content changes to convert their prospects.   This problem has not been solved in a decade and we are building an iconic company that will automate growth engineering for every company. That's why Sequoia, YCombinator, and CMOs of companies such as Snowflake and Airbnb invested. Mutiny is beloved by some of the fastest growing companies including Notion, Brex, Carta, Segment, Algolia and Qualtrics. We have quadrupled revenue year-over-year with even more on the horizon!   Our culture:  We started Mutiny by first codifying what type of company and culture we wanted to build. These values define how we approach our work every single day:   Work should feel like play Faster always wins Stir the pot, regularly Do the right thing when no one’s watching All hands on deck    Read more about our engineering values here.   The role, in a nutshell:  We are looking for a full-stack software developer to join our growing engineering team. You will build, test, and ship software across the stack including optimized APIs to distribute data in real-time, high-throughput data pipelines to power machine learning models (like OpenAI's GPT-3 and reinforcement learning algorithms from Azure), and intuitive UX to provide a powerful, easy-to-use interface. Work closely with our product, design, and CX teams to define how features will work to drive the most value for customers. Be a critical voice in choosing the right architecture for our core systems, help to define an inclusive product culture, and learn from a world-class team of experienced engineers.   What you’ll do at Mutiny:   Architect, build, test, and ship highly-available and secure services that process and serve data at scale. Use data to support product decisions and impact core business metrics with your work. Use the latest web technologies and tools. Currently, we have services in Ruby and TypeScript and invest in our tooling and automation to remain productive. Work with the most advanced machine learning services, like Open AI's GPT-3, to automatically generate optimized content for customers. Build great user experiences that allow customers to easily understand their web audience and create personalized experiences for their key segments.    What we are looking for:   2+ years of software engineering experience in a web development or infrastructure position. Fluency in a backend programming language of choice (e.g. Python, Ruby, Node, Scala, etc). Familiarity with PostgreSQL or other relational database. Advocate of automated testing. We always include a full suite of tests for a feature to verify and future proof our code. An exceptionally high performance bar for oneself and everyone on the team. Unafraid to communicate what’s working and what needs to change. Someone who is energized by ambiguity and can create structure in a dynamic, fast-paced environment. A kind human who wants to build an extraordinary product, culture and brand.    We are 100% remote. Mutiny does not accept agency submitted candidates for this posting. "

With Starburst, teams can lower the total cost of their infrastructure and analytics investments, prevent vendor lock-in, and use the existing tools that work for their business. Though Starburst has achieved a unicorn status and raised $414M in venture funding from top investors, we were founded with customers and revenue from the very beginning.

              ",On-site," Hi! We are Billie, the leading provider of “Buy Now, Pay Later” (BNPL) payment methods for businesses, offering B2B companies innovative digital payment services and modern checkout solutions. We are here to transform and upgrade the operating system of B2B Payments. Thus, we enable businesses to pay and get paid on their own terms, having the same frictionless and flexible experience as consumers are used to nowadays. To do so, our solutions are based on proprietary, machine-learning-supported risk models, fully digitized processes and a highly scalable tech platform. This makes us a deep-tech company building financial products, not the other way around. We love building simple and elegant solutions and we strive for automation and scalability. Our vision to create new freedom through innovation has attracted exciting strategic partners and highly experienced investors, making us join forces with Klarna and securing an outstanding $100 million Series C funding round nearly quadrupling our previous valuation. Our investors include VCs such as Dawn Capital, Creandum, Picus and SpeedInvest.   Join us to create the future of B2B payments!    About The Role    We are looking for a Data Engineer to join our Data Platform Engineering  team at Billie. In this team, you will help design and shape the data infrastructure and processes that interconnect our systems.   This will help us to spot fraudsters in real-time while the order is still being placed; it will allow our engineering teams to work independently while still maintaining reliable data interfaces across product domains; it will allow us to operate the data warehouse that enables data scientists and product analysts.   If we do our job well, everyone at Billie is able to use data with confidence.    As Part Of This Role, You Will    Design and develop real-time event pipelines, batch processing capabilities or a low-latency data store that serves features to ML models running in production. Work with software engineers, data scientists and business domain experts to continuously balance flexibility and reliability. As well as establishing best practices, making it easy for teams to pick the right tool for the right task. Make sure we are ready to scale - the volume of data, but also the number of contributors, releases, consumers and overall size of our systems architecture. Ensure that all data systems are operating as expected through test coverage, QA processes and monitoring, quickly detecting system failures, data outages or sudden anomalies.    Who We Are Looking For    You understand that data infrastructure can be a huge enabler for a business - but can just as well become a blocker. You're excited by the opportunity to apply your experience to a complex, quickly growing business. You understand microservice architectures and the challenges they can provide for the data domain. You have experience in processing batch and real-time data sets using cloud technologies, ideally using AWS. You have worked with columnar databases (e.g. Snowflake) and event-driven technologies (e.g Kafka, Segment). You want to apply principles of modern software development and systems architecture to the data domain. You care about reliability and data quality, and get pleasure out of a well-running system. You have experience with scheduling tools (e.g. Airflow), container technologies (e.g. Docker, Kubernetes), CI pipelines (e.g. GitHub Actions, Jenkins) and delivering Infrastructure as Code (e.g. Terraform) For you, working with humans is just as important as operating machines. You enjoy collaborating with others and are willing to question use-cases and hold people accountable to agreed standards and commitments. You have the interest to learn new technologies and methods, but also find joy in sharing your knowledge and experience with others.    What We Offer You    Flexible work hours and trust in your ability to deliver, empowering you to take control of your work-life balance. Up to 6 weeks per year of “Workation”. One of the best Virtual Shares Incentive Programs in the market, so that everyone at Billie is invested in our success. Freedom to balance working from home and the office according to you and your team’s needs. No restrictions, only guidelines and a flexibility-first approach. Our “Catch a Ride with Billie” program gives you a big discount on the Monthly Public Transport pass in Berlin. A yearly development budget to broaden your skill set and horizons. We also offer free German group classes with your colleagues. An English-speaking, multicultural team with more than 35 nationalities from all continents represented in our staff. A one-time relocation bonus if you join us in Berlin. A great office space near Checkpoint Charlie with free gym access, healthy snacks and cereals, fruit, coffee, soda, and beer.   Billie offers you the opportunity to be a part of one of the fastest-growing Fintech startups in Europe following the mission to innovate to create new freedom for businesses of all sizes. Our combined decades of experience in B2B Financing and Payments in a market thirsty for innovation and change make this a fantastic possibility to get into the most dynamic space in tech.   Join an international team of talented, passionate people where drive and merit matter. We work in nimble, cross-functional teams with open communication lines across the company. You’ll be surrounded by smart people from a wide variety of backgrounds from which you can learn and that want to learn from you.   Are you ready to join Billie? "
