In order to bring Woven City to life, Woven Alpha Inc. is developing in-house 'Digital Twin' simulations, with the goal of utilizing them to both envision and create the future. One of our team's roles is to develop and provide digital building data, a foundational component of the systems, to Digital Twin stakeholders. Woven City's need for such digital data goes beyond just 3D shapes; detailed attribute information of each element is necessary to enable them to be utilized for various simulations and services (so-called Building Information Modeling (BIM)). The data will need to be centrally managed in the cloud and updated continuously, in real time, both before and after construction. It is also crucial that the data is able to be used by all stakeholders in a timely and smooth way, according to reasonable rules.   Our team is also working to maximize the use of this digital building data to improve the efficiency of our business and the quality of the product throughout the entire construction process. Our focus is on efficient, consensus-based building among all stakeholders in the planning and design stages, elimination of rework, and improvement of work efficiency in the maintenance and management stages.   Another important initiative for our team is the development of computational design for urban planning and architectural design using Digital Twins. We also develop technology to perform design calculations with multi-objective optimizations. By quantifying evaluation indices of architectural design, we are able to develop programs for automatic shape generation based on a fixed set of rules. Through these technologies, we aim to propose better designs that go beyond the conventional limits of human design. Computational design will be intrinsically connected to the various simulations developed by other teams within Digital Twin.   Through these efforts, our team continually strives to contribute to the goals of ""better human-centered design"" and ""construction processes that can flexibly respond to change."" These, we believe, are fitting metrics for a living laboratory and ever evolving city.   WHO ARE WE LOOKING FOR?  In order to make effective use of the digital building data that forms the foundation of Woven City's Digital Twin, it is crucial to have an environment where all stakeholders (1) can smoothly use data, updated in real time, at any time, (2) be able to convert data formats, and (3) reduce data volume according to the needs of the data end users.   We are looking for a software engineer who can lead the development of such an environment and technologies. Practical experience in building and managing cloud environments and solid technical knowledge of creating the necessary data conversion tools and other program features are prerequisites.

              ",Hybrid,"  Help us make a big green dent in the universe.  We're on a mission to drive the global renewable energy revolution, and we need loads more people to help us make our vision a reality.   Our team  All technology is written and maintained by a multi-discipline engineering team of around fifty people. This includes server-side, client-side and mobile engineers working closely with UX experts, copywriters and designers.   We follow a Kanban-like approach, using Google docs and Asana to specify and manage work; Github, CircleCI and Terraform Enterprise as part of an immutable-infrastructure, continuous delivery pipeline; and Loggly, Sentry and Cloudwatch to measure performance and monitor production.   Engineering standards are high. We pair program, thoroughly review and test code before it deploys, and maintain fast, high-value test suites. We have weekly tech talks, monthly blitz-days (eg sharpening our internal tools, upgrading dependencies) and can often be found at tech meet-ups and conferences.   Our coding conventions are open-source and we maintain a tech blog.   Octopus is a great place to learn, work with some talented engineers and level-up your skills.   Our technology  On the server-side, we mainly use Python. Most of our websites are powered by Django and the Django-REST-framework. We also use Pandas, Numpy and Jupyter for analysis and forecasting, plus Celery, RabbitMQ, SQS and Airflow for background processing.   We use AWS heavily, employing most of the ""Hashistack"" (eg Packer, Consul, Terraform) as part of a continuous deployment pipeline. See, for example, Django, ELB health checks and continuous delivery.   Client-side, we use React, Redux and SASS; our mobile apps are built using React Native.   What You'll Do   We have lots of difficult design challenges to solve. The Japanese energy market is complicated, outdated and process-heavy - there's an awful lot of domain modelling that we need to get right. Strong attention to detail is essential. We have difficult technical problems to solve. With the advent of smart meters, we'll soon be processing millions of meter readings a day. We need the right technology in place to handle this smoothly as well as feeding data into a machine learning pipeline that models and predicts consumption. There's a great opportunity for disruption in the Japanese energy market. The energy landscape is changing as we move to more dis-aggregated forms of generation, with less predictability, more dynamism and smarter technology. Octopus Energy were the first UK supplier to introduce a ""tracker"" tariff whose prices track the daily wholesale prices: http://www.cleanenergynews.co.uk/news/efficiency/octopus-offers-transparency-with-wholesale-price-tariff You'll be working for a company that’s fighting climate change. Our parent company is the largest investor in solar generation in the UK, and are funding wind and anaerobic digestion. As a supplier, we're helping people to use greener technology and renewable energy, all helping move the UK towards a lower carbon future.    What You'll Have   We're looking for someone with a general interest in technology and problem-solving; someone diligent and thoughtful. It would be helpful to have experience/expertise in the following (in rough priority order): Python Django (or equiv. web framework) Domain modelling HTTP and REST APIs Writing robust and fault-tolerant software Celery and async processing Postgres    Plus experience in the following would be a bonus:   AWS Terraform, Packer, Consul React and Redux Ability to speak Japanese would be a plus    If this all sounds like you then we'd love to hear from you.  At Octopus, we're looking for genuinely decent people who are honest and empathetic. Our people are our strongest asset and the unique skills and perspectives people bring to the team are the driving force of our success.

We saw a huge problem with how much it can suck to buy a car the traditional way, so we committed ourselves to tackling one of the largest, yet-to-be-disrupted markets in the world – the $1T per year U.S. car market (yes, that’s $Trillion with a “T”).   With the ability to search thousands of vehicles from our expansive inventory, to high-resolution 360° photographs of our vehicles’ interior and exterior, to real-time financing and the ability to complete contracts without visiting the back room of a dealership, we provide a seamless, online car buying experience for consumers that can be completed from their desktop or mobile device. All our vehicles are inspected and reconditioned based on our 150-point certification checklist and come with a 7-day return policy. We also operate our own logistics network to deliver cars to customers as soon as the next day, as well as offer customer pick-up at our state-of-the-art Car Vending Machine locations (yes, you read that right).

This led us to enter the US market in 2014, the year after Mercari’s founding. The US is home to people of diverse backgrounds, of many different races, nationalities, and religions.

This is exactly why we think of the US as a microcosm for our future global expansion. It’s an extremely important country for us, where we cannot afford to fail. While this makes it much more difficult than our Japan-side operations, our US business contributes greatly to achieving Mercari’s mission, and we will continue to face the challenges of the US market going forward.   Our Culture   To achieve our mission at Mercari, our organization and each of our employees share the same values and perspectives.

In an era of increasing vehicle automation, having up-to-date and highly accurate maps is equally critical to ensuring safe vehicle operation both on the highway and on surface roads. Yet map building remains an exhaustive and highly manual process, meaning real-time high definition map updates often propagate through to the user with a delay of months or years from the date when they were collected, rendering them useless beyond limited driver assist functions. It is time for a new paradigm.   TEAM  The Map Integration team is responsible for integrating high definition (""HD"") Maps into Toyota’s next-generation automated driving Teammate vehicles.
