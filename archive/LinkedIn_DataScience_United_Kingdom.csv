              ",Remote,"  This job is 100% remote - work from anywhere in the world.     About Phaidra  Phaidra is building the future of industrial automation.  The world today is filled with static, monolithic infrastructure. Factories, power plants, buildings, etc. operate the same they've operated for decades — because the controls programming is hard-coded. Thousands of lines of rules and heuristics that define how the machines interact with each other. The result of all this hard-coding is that facilities are frozen in time, unable to adapt to their environment while their performance slowly degrades.  Phaidra creates AI-powered control systems for the industrial sector, enabling industrial facilities to automatically learn and improve over time. Specifically:   The intelligence is provided by reinforcement learning algorithms, which convert raw sensor data into high-value actions and decisions. We focus on industrial applications, which tend to be well-sensorized with measurable KPIs — perfect for reinforcement learning. We enable domain experts (our users) to configure the AI control systems (i.e. agents) without writing code. They define what they want their AI agents to do, and we do it for them.  Our team has a track record of applying AI to some of the toughest problems. From achieving superhuman performance with DeepMind's AlphaGo, to reducing the energy required to cool Google's Data Centers by 40%, we deeply understand AI and how to apply it in production for massive impact.    The configurability point is critical for your role. We believe that technology is the most powerful when it is the most usable. AI is certainly a powerful technology; however, the technical complexity of applying AI has limited its utility within the industrial sector. This is both a massive opportunity and a massive challenge.  Your role is to enable our users to interact with these complex AI technologies in the simplest and most intuitive ways possible. Our users may not be familiar with programming or AI algorithms, but they know more about how their industrial systems operate than anybody else. Your job is to bridge this gap, such that our technology is maximally useful for our users.    From a tactical perspective: we are looking for a driven Fullstack Software Engineer to be a part of our engineering team. You will work directly with senior company leaders, UI/UX designers and Product Managers to design and implement significant parts of the code base. You will have the opportunity to make an immediate impact with your work and guide the product and team as we grow.    The Product Engineering team at Phaidra is responsible for building the tools and applications that our customers use to configure and monitor our AI-powered control systems.     Responsibilities  The ideal candidate has prior experience with full stack software engineering - frontend development, backend development and DevOps activities. At Phaidra, you will:   Contribute to the development of both customer facing and internal products that extend the functionality of Phaidra's core AI platform. Contribute significantly to the frontend development efforts - Convert designs and wire frames into high-quality pixel-perfect UI in React or Angular. Collaborate with UI/UX designers and provide insights from a frontend engineering perspective. Contribute to the design and implementation of the product backends - Write REST &amp; GraphQL based API services Write highly scalable event-driven backend applications Contribute to the improvements to our core AI platform - Large-scale data ingestion and processing. Distributed model training and evaluation. Distributed inference (i.e. automated decision-making) for AI-generated recommendations or direct control. Incorporate new techniques developed by AI researchers in the platform. Build and maintain cloud infrastructure on GCP. Perform DevOps duties of CI/CD, Release &amp; Deployment management.     Key Qualifications   0+ years of work experience. Bachelors or Masters in Computer Science, or equivalent experience. Full stack development experience Experience in JavaScript, CSS3 (preferably with a pre-processing framework like SASS/SCSS) &amp; HTML5 Expertise in a modern JavaScript SPA framework like React, Vue or Angular. Experience writing and using REST, GraphQL and/or gRPC services. Experience modeling relational and non-relational data. Experience with a cloud service like AWS, GCP, Azure or similar. Share our company values: curiosity, ownership, transparency &amp; directness, outcome-based performance, and customer empathy.     Preferred Qualifications   Multiple years of experience using an SPA framework. Experience developing production level backend applications.

Company Mission and Vision:     OxDXis a University of Oxford spin out company that uses high-resolution microscopy in combination with machine learning to identify pathogens in just a few seconds.

Initial training will involve bringing you up to speed on our products, teaching you our internal programming language, and making sure that you have all other necessary technical expertise. However, we take a “learn by doing” approach where, as soon as possible, you will be assigned real tasks and adding value to the company.   This work would appeal to graduates with a broad knowledge of computing who like to continually learn new things and do not mind dealing with rapidly changing priorities and projects. This is an opportunity to join and learn from enthusiastic – like minded engineers to work on exciting projects with a real-world impact.   Our Teams:   Market Data –  This team looks after the data that TradingHub buys from other companies. As this data comes from many vendors in many structures we process and store it in ways to make it easier for other teams to consume. In this role you will primarily be programming in Sozy (our bespoke programming language) and C#, writing code to automate the processing of data feeds. You will also be involved in the scheduling of these automated scripts and ensuring that they successfully ran each day. As well as this you will assist in answering queries and challenges regarding our data from clients.   Pricing  - The key remit of this individual would be working with the Pricing team to create the financial pricing libraries, calculators as well as risk/pricing-related algorithms to be utilised across TradingHub’s platform. You would be part of a tight-knit team who plays a critical role in allowing us to ingest millions of trades and transform them into vectors of risk that can be processed by our cutting-edge machine learning models.   This process is central to all our products as it allows us to consider our clients’ positions as a basket of risk exposures rather than independent trades. For example, a trade in a convertible bond could be used by a rogue trader to abuse the equity market or the rates market.   XProd  -At TradingHub we have created an extremely performant functional relational programming language. This language is used to describe a graph of inputs and outputs, where each node is a relational/SQL-like operation such as a join, group by or filter. The XProd team aims to capitalise on these developments and to create value-driven solutions that utilise our bespoke language. In this role you will be building tools and solutions for enterprise software.   MAST/TEAM/AML/Ecomms  - We are looking for full stack developers to help build and support our core TradingHub data-analytical products such as MAST, RTMS, AML and Ecomms. Experience writing C# is desirable. However, experience using any object-oriented programming language would be useful to learn Sozy, our internal programming language.   QA  - The QA team maintain oversite of all tools, standards and procedures for ensuring our created software provides an optimal client experience. Everything from reviewing 3rd party control systems to writing in house DevOps tooling. We are involved with every team and always look to create generic, reusable solutions with whichever tools are most appropriate. This work would appeal to candidates with a broad knowledge of computing who like to continually learn new things and do not mind dealing with rapidly changing priorities and projects.   Requirements   Proficiency with C#, SQL, Python or any object oriented programming language STEM degree Flexibility to work in a fast-paced environment, often utilising proprietary methods Comfortable working in a team Excellent communication skills with a self-starting attitude Having an interest in financial markets is desirable    Benefits   Ambition: Extremely fast-growing company with an uncapped potential, offering every colleague a broad range of experience and plenty of opportunities for internal movement, as well as rapid career progression. Vibrant company culture full of uniquely talented and friendly colleagues with regular social perks to build camaraderie. Flexibility: Flexible working policy (up to 3 days a week remote); 25 days holiday + bank holidays, informal dress code and excellent work/life balance. Generous maternity/parental leave policies. Reward: Highly competitive compensation plus annual discretionary bonus and discretionary EMI scheme (company share option scheme). Support: Annual personal training budget, private healthcare, company pension plan, death in service coverage, cycle to work scheme &amp; tech scheme.  "
